# Prototype

gertrude [options](#flags)

## Flags

- **-d** *OPTIONAL* : Should specify a directory. [See Example](#directory)
- **\--var** or **-v** *OPTIONAL* : Should specify a variable. [See Example](#variables)
- **\--rule** or **-r** *OPTIONAL* : Should specify a rules with *deps* and *cmds*. [See Example](#rules)
    - **\--deps** or **-D** : Should specify dependency for the given rule.
    - **\--cmd** or **-c** : Should specify a command for the given rule.
- **\--epi** or **-e** *OPTIONAL* : Creates a prefilled header for Makefiles. [See Example](#epiheader)
- **config** : Configure gertrude **as you wish!** [See Example](#config)

If Gertrude is called without options, it will generate a basic Makefile that you can modify in the directory where you executed her.

### Examples
- #### Directory
	- ```gertrude -d path/to/lib/ [...]``` ==> Gertrude will create a Makefile in the specified directory path/to/lib/

- #### Variables
	- ```gertrude -v SRC="$(wildcard *.c)"``` ==> Gertrude will create a Makefile containing the specified variable with name SRC and value $(wildcard *.c)

- #### Rules
	- ```gertrude -r lib -D $(OBJS_LIB) --cmd "echo Good Plant"``` ==> Gertrude will create a Makefile with the rule 'lib' which will depend on the object files for the lib, and will execute the command ```echo Good Plant```

- #### EpiHeader
	- ```gertrude [...] --epi``` ==> The Makefile will be started with the standard EPITECH school's header which is as follows:

```
##
## EPITECH PROJECT, 2023
## project_name
## File description:
## description
##
```

- #### Config
	- ```gertrude config``` ==> This will open the configuration file your set editor (defaults to nano). **Warning**, editing sections that are not meant to be edited will result in undefined behaviour. Such sections are marked with ```/* Do not edit above/below this line*/```. Editable values are clearly explained in a comment above the latter.
