### Examples
//

# Commit norm

Commits to this project should follow a commit norm.
When adding a major feature, the commit should be a sentence, starting with "Gertrude now...", followed by a sentence that makes sense (and a :seedling: if you want to use gitmoji).

When adding minor features, files, or others, it should start with [ADD], and then the files' names or a description.

Modifications should start with [MOD], except when they're made on the "base" of Gertrude, in which case it should be a comprehensible sentence describing what exactly was modified.

Removed files or folders should be commited as [REMOVE] or [REM] followed by a file name or folder path.

You should do your best to make logical and small commits, but you can stack commits by naming them "[ADD] file1, file2, minor-feature1 [MOD] feature1, file1". Gertrude's base's changes should be pushed using their own commit.
